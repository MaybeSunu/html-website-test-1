			<p>ì •í™˜ is a <b><i><u>poopoo-man</b></i></u> and <b>EVERYONE</b> wants to kill him due to his tarnish.</b></P>
			<p>ðŸ’©</p>
			<p>not only is he a poopooman, there are a lot of other shitty things that she is; these are some of those:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>poopoo</li>
				<li>poo</li>
				<li>shit</li>
				<li>dung</li>
				<li>ðŸ’©</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This is how he became the <i>"poopooman"</i>:
			<ol>
				<li>He ate a poo</li>
				<li>He liked it</li>
				<li>He ate more</li>
				<li>The high portion of the poo taking over his body started giving the body stimuli</li>
				<li>The body cells start activating the hidden code in the DNA due to the stimuli</li>
				<li>The DNA triggers the body cells' alteration: changing into poo</li>
				<li>This process goes on and eventually takes over all the body</li>
